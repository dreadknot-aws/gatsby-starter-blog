Survival Log: Day 1 - 49

7 Blood moons ago,

I seem to have survived the flu. I didn't die. I'm still green from it. I look like the photo on the front page of the newspaper left laying around.

I don't remember how I got here, but the water treatment plant has become a base of operations. The water tower high above the ground and limited entry ways is the safest place I've found so far. A few storage boxes and a bedroll has turned the interior into a life pod. On method of moving around the town is to move from water tower to water tower. The water inside can be bottled and boiled.

On my person I carry:

A Spear - I like stabbing zombies from some distance
A Bow - Stabbing from even further away
A light - Attack the darkness

In my bag I carry:

We've survived four horde nights. Some notes for other survivors:

Use scrap iron to make junk turret ammo. Load the ammo and place the turret near your base. Remember you can pick it up and shoot it yourself. Conserve the firearm ammo.

Found a large home with some farm plots in an open roof. Planning on a mission to replant it. Lower levels looked like a scientist was experimenting with creating a super corn. This may help to feed the family.

I'm invected and looking for antibiotics.

Skill points I've spent:

Anything that will help me cure my infection.
