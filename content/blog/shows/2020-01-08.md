# Happy New Year Kids

Oldgoat recieved two albums for chistsmas and both have seriuous warping. How about trying one of these methods? https://www.wikihow.com/Fix-a-Warped-Vinyl-Record

The game audio is way to loud. Turning it down in the OBS mixer makes it so we don't hear it very well. Going to add a headphone amp to the audio setup. I suspect since we split the output we are not hearing an acurate mix.

Write 2020 instead of just 20. What's the risk?
